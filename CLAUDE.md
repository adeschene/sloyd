## Status

**v1 shipped**, followed by a polish pass (unique board names, `NameField`,
`Delete`/`Backspace`, origin axes, a settled grid, a stable gizmo), then follow-ups
29-30 (a gizmo size ceiling, a separate origin-lines checkbox), and now **v2**:
two-state grain orientation, schema version 2 with a migration, the reorient-pivot
fix, and wood grain textures. Static SPA, containerized, 258/258 tests passing.

Host-specific deployment detail — hostname, container name, proxy configuration, and
the manual steps a human has to perform — lives in `DEPLOYMENT.local.md`, which is
gitignored. Read that file before deploying; it is not in the public repo.

v2 shipped what v1 deferred as "Spec B" — orientation and grain. v1's design and
`docs/follow-ups.md` both once called joinery "v2"; the naming is now settled (see the
v2 spec's non-goals): joinery gets its own spec and version label after this one, and
the cut list stays behind that. **Next up is joinery** (dados/rabbets), then the cut
list. The parametric board model exists specifically to make both cheap to add.

**What v2 actually did**, at the end of
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-30-sloyd-v1-polish-design.md` under "Deferred to
Spec B" (design in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-30-sloyd-v2-design.md`):

- **Orientation semantics.** The four-value rotation select is now a two-state
  **Grain** select, "Along X" / "Along Z" — a rectangular box has 2-fold symmetry
  about the vertical axis, so 0°/180° and 90°/270° were always literally
  indistinguishable. `Rotation` is narrowed to `0 | 90`. The real bug alongside it was
  that rotation pivoted about nothing: `boardExtents` swapped the extents and left the
  min-corner pinned, so a 24×5½ board jumped sideways when it turned.
  `reorientedPosition` fixes that by preserving the footprint's X/Z centre and the
  Y-min. **This is the one thing that moved the schema:** `CURRENT_VERSION` is now 2,
  with a migration folding 180→0 and 270→90.
- **Wood grain textures.** Face, edge and end grain distinguished per face, with
  plywood showing veneer on its faces and visible plies on its edges.

## What Sloyd is

Modelling and planning for woodworking projects: lay out the parts of a build in 3D,
see how they fit, and get the numbers you need at the bench (dimensions, cut list).
Not a general-purpose CAD tool — the domain assumptions (boards, stock thickness,
fractional inches) are the point.

The name is from *sloyd* (Swedish *slöjd*), the Scandinavian handicraft education
tradition built around hand woodworking.

## Architecture

Static single-page app. No server, no database, no API, no env vars.

**Governing rule: the plain-JSON document is the source of truth; the Three.js scene
is derived from it and is never authoritative.** A document is
`{ version, name, units, boards: [...] }`. Dragging a board in the viewport computes a
number, writes it to the document, and the scene re-renders from the updated document
— never the reverse. This is what keeps undo, save/load, and export simple: they only
ever serialize or restore the document.

Module dependency order (each layer only depends on the ones before it):

1. **`units`** and **`document`** — both leaves of the dependency graph; each imports
   nothing from the rest of the app. `units` parses/formats fractional inches (e.g.
   `24 1/2"`). `document` owns the document schema, board geometry, validation, and
   versioned migration. `document/names.ts` is a leaf alongside it, importing only the
   `Board` type.
2. **`store`** (Zustand + snapshot-based undo/redo) and **`storage`** (the
   `StorageAdapter` seam) — both sit above `document`.
3. **`viewport`** (react-three-fiber scene, camera, grid, gizmo) and **`panels`**
   (React forms: toolbar, parts list, properties panel) — both read/write through the
   store, and both also import `document` directly for its exported types and
   constants (`panels` for `MATERIALS`, `DocumentError`, `Rotation`, `uniqueName`; `viewport` for
   geometry helpers). `panels` additionally imports the `storage` adapter singleton
   for export/import. These are legitimate downward imports, not a layering
   violation — `document` and `storage` sit below both.

Notable modelling detail: a board's `position` is the **min-corner** of its world
bounding box, not its center. This matters anywhere geometry or the gizmo touches
position math.

**Storage seam:** all persistence — autosave, export, import — goes through
`StorageAdapter`. Nothing else touches `localStorage` or the filesystem directly. A
future desktop build would be a second implementation of that same interface, not a
parallel code path.

**Versioning:** every document carries a `version` field, and every load path (open,
import, autosave-restore) runs through `migrateDocument` before the document is
trusted. This is what lets the schema evolve (e.g. for joinery) without breaking files
saved by earlier versions. `CURRENT_VERSION` is 2; the v1→v2 fold (`foldRotationToV2`,
180→0 and 270→90) is the worked example every future migration step should match —
see invariant 11 for why it runs where it does.

Full detail: `docs/superpowers/specs/` (design) and `docs/superpowers/plans/`
(implementation plan). This section is a summary, not a replacement for either.

## Invariants — break these and things fail in confusing ways

Each of these cost real debugging during v1. They are load-bearing, not style.

1. **The document is the source of truth.** No component may hold geometry state that
   isn't derived from it, and nothing may write to a Three.js object's transform as a
   way of recording a change.
2. **`position` is the min-corner**, not the center. `boardCenter` exists because
   Three.js meshes are center-origin and the document is not. Reorienting a board
   pivots it about itself — `reorientedPosition` in `document/geometry.ts` is the
   only place that arithmetic lives, and `store.updateBoard` is what applies it,
   whenever a patch changes `rotation` or `standing` without carrying its own
   `position`. `reorientedPosition` takes the whole patch (`Partial<Board>`), not just
   `{ rotation, standing }` — a patch that also changes a dimension needs the pivot
   computed from the *post-patch* extents, and `store.updateBoard` passes the patch
   straight through rather than reconstructing a narrower object, for the same
   undefined-overwrite reason that once justified the narrower one.
3. **The `dragging` ref guard in `Gizmo.tsx`.** `TransformControls` computes motion from
   state captured at drag start; syncing the document into the proxy mid-drag makes it
   fight itself. The symptom is jitter or drift, not a crash.
4. **Gesture snapshots are lazy** — taken on the first `edit()` inside a gesture, not in
   `beginGesture()`. Eager snapshotting leaves no-op undo entries, so `Ctrl+Z` appears
   to do nothing.
5. **`DimensionField` only commits when `dirty`.** Otherwise focusing and blurring a
   field re-parses the *rounded display text* and writes it back, silently quantizing
   exact values (18mm → 11/16"). Stored values are exact; display rounds.
6. **`add_header` does not merge across nginx levels.** A `location` block containing any
   `add_header` discards everything inherited — which is why `security-headers.conf` is
   `include`d in every block rather than set once on the server.
7. **`autoSave` must never throw.** It reports failure via `storage.available`, which
   drives the warning banner.
8. **Board names are unique, and enforced in four places** — `addBoard`,
   `duplicateBoard`, the name-field commit, and `migrateDocument`. Creation-only
   enforcement is not enough: an imported or hand-edited file would violate it.
   `createBoard` cannot dedupe (it has no view of the document), so any new call
   site that adds a board must pass its name through `uniqueName` itself.
   `validateBoard` trims before checking for blank — a whitespace-only name is
   blank too — so `migrateDocument` never hands `dedupeNames` something that
   trims to `''`.
9. **`NameField` commits once, on blur or Enter — never per keystroke.** An
   emptied name reverts, and that is only possible with a single commit: writing
   per keystroke and correcting on blur takes the gesture's undo snapshot before
   the correction lands, leaving an entry that undoes to nothing. Its `onCommit`
   returns the stored name because dedup can store something other than what was
   typed.
10. **The gizmo size clamp writes `size` *before* the library's `updateMatrixWorld`,
    never `handle.scale` after it.** `size` is an input to three-stdlib's scale
    computation, so the library bakes the correction itself and nothing needs
    recomposing. Correcting the output instead lands in the re-bake trap that
    invariant 3's neighbouring comment block documents at length. Related: the clamp
    is two-sided *and* has a floor on the cap itself (`GIZMO_MIN_CAP_INCHES`) — a
    board-relative ceiling alone governs close range too and shrinks the gizmo for
    small parts the moment they are selected.
11. **Migration steps run on raw data, before `validateBoard`.** `validateBoard` falls
    back to `0` for an unknown rotation, so a fold that ran after it would turn every
    saved 270° board a quarter turn the wrong way — and unlike 0-vs-180, that is a
    different shape on screen, not just a redundant one. Upgrade first, validate
    second.
12. **Grain textures are cached at module level and never disposed; per-board
    variation lives in the `uv` attribute, never on the texture.** `texture.repeat`/
    `offset`/`rotation` are per-texture state on an object every board shares —
    writing them per board would make every board on screen fight over one mapping.
    The per-board offset in `boardUVs` is zeroed on any axis a `FacePlan` marks
    `fit`: the whole tile is shown either way on a `FIT` axis, so an offset there
    buys no variation and only shifts the pattern's seam into the middle of the
    face — exactly what `FIT` exists to avoid on wood ends and plywood's ply stack.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server; use --port <n> to avoid collisions
npm test           # Vitest, currently 258 tests
npm run build      # tsc -b && vite build — this is the typecheck gate
docker compose up -d --build    # deploy (see DEPLOYMENT.local.md first)
```

`npm test` does **not** typecheck. A green suite proves nothing about `tsc`; run
`npm run build` before claiming anything compiles.

## Open follow-ups

`docs/follow-ups.md` lists everything found during v1 review, the two polish passes,
and v2, consciously deferred rather than missed, numbered 1-30 plus v2's additions.
Read it before starting new work in the same area — several items are "correct but
untested", which is exactly what a refactor breaks silently.

**29 and 30 are closed** — the gizmo now has a size ceiling tied to the selected board
(with a floor that keeps it grabbable when zoomed far out), and the origin lines have
their own toolbar checkbox. **5 is closed** — the version gate now rejects versions
below 1 and non-integer versions. All three closures are written up in place. With
those done, **joinery is the next work.**

One entry is a lesson rather than a defect and is worth reading before touching anything
in the viewport: **26a**. Browser verification on this host runs on software GL
(llvmpipe, no GPU), which returns 1.0 for `pow(0.0, 0.0)` where real hardware returns
NaN. That difference hid a grid bug completely — it looked correct in every screenshot
and shipped as a camera-following disc. Anything resting on undefined or
precision-sensitive shader behaviour needs a human looking at real hardware.

Host-level open items (proxy auth, Cloudflare, monitoring) are in
`DEPLOYMENT.local.md`, not in the public repo.

## Deployment

Sloyd builds to static files served by nginx from a multi-stage image
(`docker compose up -d --build`). No bind mounts, no named volumes, no `.env` — there
is deliberately no server-side state to persist, because the document lives entirely in
the browser behind `StorageAdapter`. The nginx config does SPA-fallback routing so a
refresh on a deep route resolves to `index.html` rather than 404ing.

**Everything host-specific — hostname, container name, network, proxy setup, and the
manual steps only a human can do — is in `DEPLOYMENT.local.md` (gitignored).** Read it
before deploying or touching anything on the host.

## Working agreements

- Build incrementally: small v1, then widen. Prefer shipping a narrow thing that works.
- Design docs live in `docs/superpowers/specs/`; read the latest before changing behavior.
- **No pull requests.** Solo repo — commit to `master`, or branch and merge locally
  (`git merge --no-ff`, verify the merged tree, then delete the branch). Don't open PRs.
- TDD where it pays. `units` is tested hardest on purpose: a quiet bug there produces
  wrong measurements, and wrong measurements waste lumber. The r3f viewport has no unit
  tests by design — verify it by driving a real browser, not by asserting on mocks.
- When a review finding conflicts with what a plan or spec says, that's a human
  decision, not one to resolve silently either way.
- Prefer closing latent bugs over deferring them, including ones only reachable on a
  future platform — the storage seam exists precisely so a desktop build stays cheap.
